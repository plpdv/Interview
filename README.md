# Vending machine of Evil!

**Before we start:**

1. The instructor will provide with a branch. Use **only said branch** for this training.
2. Download with **git clone** 
3. Change to your branch.

* Note: You will need to host it locally thus, I highly suggest using *Visual Studio Code* with the extension of *live server* it eases the burden of reloading after every change too. If, you go down this road, select 'index.html' as your service. (Right click-> 'Open with Live Server')

* Note 2: Do not peek into other's branches. It is likely it will be recorded this will heavily impact on your image.

**Welcome developer!**

My name is Eviru! The evil vending machine! So, my dear friends, we'll be using this as a little test to understand your logic, developer skills and, creativity! 

* Difficulty: **Medium**
* Objectives:

# CSS:
1. Create a CSS file named 'utils.css' and, import it to the main HTML file. (index.HTML)
2. Create a CSS class that will bold only the titles of the card elements. (I.e. G3-Energy, D4-0R0, etc)
3. Create a CSS class to change the font to UPPERCASE.

Extra:
* Add a nice CSS class(up to your preference) to perform on hover events for the buttons. We want to colour them. (Active/inactive)

# HTML:
1. Find out why we can't use the init.js file (we need this to move on so, take it as high priority).
2. Restrict the input with the id of 'moneyByUser' to a max 100 and a minimum of 0.
3. Fix the div with the class 'shr3k'. Make it either uppercase or capitalized. Use either style or a class.

# JS (Javascript)
1. Discover why the method 'getSodas' is not working
2. Use the method 'sekibanki' to provide the change. Feel free to use anything to accomplish this. (*Create variables, methods, files, rename methods, anything*)
 * Things you will need to calculate:
 * How many 'x' coins are needed to fulfil the amount.
 * i.e. The user paid with $14, selects a beverage of $12. His change should be 2. Either provide 2 coins of $1 or, 1 coin of $2. 
 * i.e.2  The user paid with $50 a beverage of $12. His change is $38.
Perhaps, a good way to return it could be: 1 - $20, 1 - $10, 1 - $5 and, 1 - $2 and 1- $1.
3. Print the result in a friendly user way! Be creative! (Alerts, spans, etc)

Bonus on JS:
* Reduce the coins used from the array: 'currentMoneyInsideMachine'.
Note: You don't have to add the user's input money for the sake of simplicity. Thus, the machine only has $1,000 available for this operation, scattered on different values.

# Suggestion:
I, as your benevolent ally, shall share a little word of advice. Try to approach everything in the following order:
HTML 1
JS 1 
JS 2
HTML 2
CSS 1
CSS 2
CSS 3
HTML 3
JS 3

A different way to do this is:
HTML -> JS -> CSS

But in the end, it's all up to you and your own comfort! Don't give up! >.<

Remember, all of this will go straight to **another development team**. Have this on mind when working on your solution, you never know who will read your code, perhaps, a dog, a cat, a good developer, a bad one, a monster or, some fancy protagonist.
